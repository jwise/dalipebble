This program is a very simple -- and ugly -- port of Dali Clock.  Very
little care was taken to homogenize C style, and globals are strewn about
like Halloween candy.  Any distasteful style within should be considered to
be the work of myself, and not of Jamie!

To do:
  * Add more graceful 12-hour support.
  * Add support for showing seconds.  (Requires PebbleOS support.)
